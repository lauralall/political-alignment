# Political alignment and values in Estonia
Authors: Kristina Kivistik, Sadu Maria Jaarman, Laura Lall  
Group: G5  
Motivation and goal of the project:  
Human values play a foundational role in shaping individual perspectives and collective societal trends, influencing everything from personal decision-making to broader societal trends. In Estonia, a country shaped by its history and evolving democratic system, understanding values is also key to understanding what drives political behavior. By analyzing the correlations between political alignement, human values, gender and age, the project seeks to uncover the societal factors underlying political orientation, contributing to deeper insights into Estonia's sociopolitical dynamics.  
Project dataset: project_dataset.csv, from European Social Survery (ESS) round 10, with values for age and gender.  
Project code: project.ipynb  
Project report: G5_report.pdf  
Downloading the project code along with the dataset and running it with Jupyter Notebook will replicate the same analysis results that we gathered.
