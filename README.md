# Values and Political Alignment in Estonia
Authors: Kristina Kivistik, Sadu Maria Jaarman, Laura Lall  
Group: G5  
Motivation and goal of the project:
Human values play a foundational role in shaping individual perspectives and collective societal trends, influencing everything from personal decision-making to broader societal trends. In Estonia, a country shaped by its history and evolving democratic system, understanding values is also key to understanding what drives political behavior. Therefore, this project seeks to explore the connection between human values and political self-placement on the left-right scale.
